**Brief Discription:**

This system consists of micro-controller board, sensors, SD card module, push button, breadboard and jumpers. Also, it has an accompanied java program. The system is designed to measure the vitals of its user. The triggered vitals are the temperature and the heartbeats rate. The elderly should put the sensors on his body, then the sensors will keep tracking these vitals periodically. If there is an abnormality in the vitals "Case of Emergency", the system will send an alert through an SMS. Moreover, the system sends an email including the vitals to form real time communication. The Java program allows the user to enter recipient email address and phone number, to which the periodic vitals and alert will be sent. Also, the user has to add his/her ID; to be sent in the SMS and the email along side with the vitals. It facilitates verifying whose vitals these are for the receiver. The history of vitals is saved on the SD card using the SD card module. Furthermore, the system includes a push button; in order to let the elderly send an alert on purpose.
